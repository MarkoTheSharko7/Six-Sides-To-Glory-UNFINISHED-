# Six-Sides-To-Glory-UNFINISHED-
I am creating a medieval turn-based strategy game where the game plays out on a world of identifiable hexagonal tiles. Each tile will have terrain types such as land, water, mountains, etc and can be owned by a player, an AI opponent, unhabitable or even no one. The ultimate goal of the game is to control the whole world by expanding their territory but the user can do this in many ways which will be completely down to their preferences whether this is obtained through declaring wars, truces, betraying and backstabbing while also having to take care of their economy and diplomacy while competing against AI with different personalities. However the user must also beware of their countries stats, as if their Diplomacy, Economy or happiness falls to low, it will result in a revolution meaning you will lose.

So far the game is only a hexagonal grid based map with functioning grid responses to inputs from the user

TO RUN THE GAME "main.PY" MUST BE INSTALLED ALONGSIDE THE "game" FOLDER AS THEY ARE ESSENTIAL FOR RUNNING THE CODE, MAKE SURE "main.PY" IS NOT INSIDE THE "game" FOLDER BUT IN THE SAME LOCATION.
